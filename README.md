# 4C16-Deep-Learning
Fourth Year Deep Learning Module using Python 

Lab 0 <br />
Lab 0 was used as a 'refresher' to Python, involving some simple excercises and syntax. <br />

Lab 1 <br />
This lab involves using Linear Regression techniques to complete a series of excersises. <br />
EX1 - Compute a polynomial design matrix <br />
EX2 - Implement Tikhonov's method in order to regularise the data.  <br /> 
EX3 - Compute the mean squared error of two vectors labeled y1, y2 <br />
EX4 - Evaluate the best polynomial order for modelling the data through examination of graphs of the effects of different polynomial orders. <br />
