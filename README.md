# 4C16-Deep-Learning
Fourth Year Deep Learning Module using Python 

**Lab 0** <br />
Lab 0 was used as a 'refresher' to Python, involving some simple excercises and syntax. <br />

**Lab 1** <br />
This lab involves using Linear Regression techniques to complete a series of excersises. <br />
-EX1 - Compute a polynomial design matrix <br />
-EX2 - Implement Tikhonov's method in order to regularise the data.  <br /> 
-EX3 - Compute the mean squared error of two vectors labeled y1, y2 <br />
-EX4 - Evaluate the best polynomial order for modelling the data through examination of graphs of the effects of different polynomial orders. <br />

**Lab 2** <br />
Explore the use of logistic regression, completing different tasks such as: <br />
-EX1 - Write a function to compute the average cross entropy. <br /> 
-EX2 - Compute the gradient of the data <br />
-EX3 - Evaluate the best learning rate for the data, by observation <br />
-EX4 - Complete a predict_class function which uses weights, matrix of data X and threshhold 't' to classify the data. <br />
-EX5 - Evaluate the accuracy of the classifier when the threshold value is set to 0.5 <br />
